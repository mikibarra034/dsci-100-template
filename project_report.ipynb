    "   Heart disease is a major global cause of death that takes millions of lives per year. According to the CDC, there is one death in the US every 34 seconds due to heart disease. Not only is this unfortunate for those â…• people who suffer this demise, but it also costs billions of dollars in health care services. Heart disease data sets such as this one can be useful to predict factors that make certain demographics of people more susceptible for suffering from a heart disease, thus allowing the development of mitigation strategies."
